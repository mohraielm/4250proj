# Civil Engineering Department Faculty Search Engine

This project was created for CS4250: Web Search and Recommender Systems in Fall 2024. It aims to create a search engine for students at Cal Poly Pomona to explore faculty research topics that align with their interests. Currently, students must individually check each faculty memberâ€™s page on the CPP website, which is considerably slower. As a proof of concept, this project focuses only on searching for faculty from the Civil Engineering Department.

## Demo Video
